Hey, I'm Shaurya, a computer scientist with a passion for merging the realms of technology and business applications. As a student of the University of California, Riverside, my journey has been one of both academic excellence and real-world impact. My work, particularly with NASA and the City of Los Angeles, reflects my commitment to using technology for societal benefit, such as predicting air pollution levels with precision and developing accessible tech solutions.

My professional pursuits are matched by a deep-seated love for research and continuous learning. At UC Riverside, I immersed myself in challenging projects, extracting and processing data from diverse sources. This experience, coupled with my front-end development internship at Klear.ai, has broadened my understanding of user-centric design and application development.

Beyond the world of technology, I have a profound fondness for chess. This game of strategy and foresight mirrors the complexities and problem-solving skills I employ in my professional life. Additionally, I am an enthusiastic participant in pick-up basketball games, which not only keep me physically active but also serve as a great way to connect with people and unwind.

My accolades, such as being featured in NASA's Earth Science Technology Office Report and emerging victorious in competitive programming, are a testament to my dedication and innovative mindset. I hope my website can provide a canvas to show my work in the field of computer science and help me keep track of how far I have come :).
