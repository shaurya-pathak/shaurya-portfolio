Hey, I'm Shaurya, an aspiring computer scientist with a desire to make an impact on the world. I have been blessed to be a part of NASA's Predicting What We Breathe where I have had the opportunity to apply machine learning to many different pollution problems and visualize it in a manner such that stakeholders can make optimal decisions.

I have taken a broad range of courses at UC Riverside, including but not limited to Artificial Intelligence courses, algorithms, and even business courses. I believe that this dip into business has give me the perspective of being able to understand what a developer should look like from a consumer center point of view.

Beyond technology and work, I enjoy playing and following chess as a hobby, I feel an immense satisfaction when I am able to win a game of chess. I also enjoy playing pickup basketball wherever I go to meet new people and stay active.

I have been honored through being featured in NASA's ESTO report along with being a winner in Programming Competitions.
